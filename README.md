## The problem

Every company speaks its own language. After a few weeks in a new job you have
heard about the **CRS**, filed something in the **DMS**, missed a deadline set
by the **CAB** and wondered whether **POS** means *Point of Sale* or *Purchase
Order System*. (In our case: both.)

The running joke behind this project:

> Pick any three random letters – our company probably has a meaning for them.

There are exactly **26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576** combinations of three letters.
**26³** turns the joke into a shared goal: find out how many of them actually
mean something inside your company, and build a useful glossary along the way.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/home.png" alt="26³ home page showing the global progress towards 17,576 combinations" width="820">
</p>

## What it does

- **Global progress.** One number everyone works on together: discovered
  acronyms out of 17,576.
- **Glossary search.** Type three letters, get every known meaning, who added
  it and when. Unknown acronyms come with an *Add* button.
- **Submissions with validation.** The uppercase letters of a meaning have to
  spell the acronym (`AOF` → *Allocation and Offer Force*), checked live in the
  browser and again on the server.
- **Ambiguity is a feature.** Several meanings per acronym are expected. Finding
  a second meaning is the most valuable move in the game.
- **Points, scoreboard and history.** Every submission is scored, users compete
  on a scoreboard and each profile shows how the score came together.
- **English and German.** Language switch in the header, browser language by
  default. Adding another language is one dictionary file.
- **Single sign-on via OpenID Connect.** Works with Keycloak, Microsoft Entra
  ID, Okta, Auth0, Google, Authentik, Zitadel and any other OIDC provider –
  configured with a few environment variables.

## How the game works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/scoring.svg" alt="Scoring: +5 new acronym, +10 duplicate found, +1 existing entry, 0 already submitted" width="820">
</p>

| Outcome             | When                                                   | Points |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -----: |
| `NEW_ACRONYM`       | Nobody has submitted this acronym yet                  |     +5 |
| `DUPLICATE_FOUND`   | The acronym exists, but this meaning is new            |    +10 |
| `EXISTING_ENTRY`    | Acronym and meaning are both already documented        |     +1 |
| `ALREADY_SUBMITTED` | You have already submitted this exact meaning          |      0 |
| `INVALIDATED_MEANING` | An admin removed this meaning (see [Admins](#admins)) |      0 |

A few rules keep it fair:

- **Uppercase letters spell the acronym.** Only uppercase letters count, so
  filler words can stay lowercase: *Allocation and Offer Force* is `AOF`. A
  word that belongs to the acronym must be capitalized: *Point Of Sale* is
  `POS`, while *Point of Sale* would be `PS`.
- **One score per person and meaning.** You cannot score the same meaning of
  `ABC` twice. A *different* meaning of `ABC` still counts – as a duplicate
  find, even if you were the one who discovered `ABC`.
- **Meanings are compared normalized.** Case and extra whitespace are ignored,
  so `Point Of Sale` and `  Point  Of  Sale ` are the same meaning. There is no
  fuzzy matching.
- **Progress counts acronyms, not meanings.** `ABC` with three meanings is one
  of 17,576.
- **The server decides.** The browser only sends the acronym and the meaning;
  points and outcome are always computed on the server.

## Use it in your company

26³ is built so that any organization drowning in acronyms can run its own
instance. To make it yours:

1. **Fork or clone** this repository.
2. **Provide a PostgreSQL database** (any PostgreSQL 14+ works; see
   [Getting started](#getting-started)).
3. **Connect your identity provider** via OpenID Connect – see
   [Authentication](#authentication).
4. **Adjust the texts** in [`lib/i18n.ts`](lib/i18n.ts) – the wording says
   "our company" and works as is, but you can mention your company by name or
   add a language.
5. **Replace the seed data** in [`src/prisma/seed.ts`](src/prisma/seed.ts) with
   a few real acronyms, or start empty and let people discover them.
6. **Deploy** it wherever you run Node.js – see [Deployment](#deployment).

### Forking to an internal GitLab

To work on a GitHub project while keeping your changes in your company's
GitLab, create an empty project in GitLab first. Do not initialize it with a
README, license or other files. Then clone GitHub and configure GitLab as
`origin` and GitHub as `upstream`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<project>.git
cd <project>
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin git@gitlab.company.com:<group>/<project>.git
git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags
```

Check the destinations with `git remote -v`. With this setup, a plain `git
push` pushes to the GitLab `origin`; `upstream` is the GitHub source. A push
to GitHub would require explicitly pushing to `upstream`.

To bring in later GitHub changes, fetch and merge the relevant upstream branch,
then push it to GitLab:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

Replace `main` with the branch used by the source repository. This workflow
supports internal changes and normal Git history; use `git clone --mirror` only
if the GitLab project should remain an exact mirror with no separate internal
commits.

The [GitLab pipeline](.gitlab-ci.yml) uses shared templates from `cdp/cicd`
at `2.0.2`; forks need access to that project or equivalent local templates.
Default-branch pushes only build and scan; tag pushes publish and release images,
then deploy the Helm chart into the existing production namespace. Merge-request
pipelines and deployments from branches are disabled.

For deployment, configure `SECRET_VALUES` as a protected GitLab file variable
containing production Helm values. The production namespace must already exist
and match `K8S_NAMESPACE`. Set `database.url` in that values file to the
complete PostgreSQL connection string. Helm creates the
database Secret from this URL; the pre-install migration receives it directly.
The database and OIDC keys share one `<release>-secret`. Credentials are stored
in Helm release metadata and the migration Job specification, so restrict
access to these resources and release history. When all database and OIDC
secret values are empty, the chart uses a pre-existing `<release>-secret` with
all configured keys. The image-pull Secret must still be provisioned as
configured. Validate the merged configuration with GitLab CI Lint before
enabling protected release tags.

Example `SECRET_VALUES` file (replace the example values; never commit real
credentials):

```yaml
database:
  url: "postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:5432/<database>?sslmode=require"

oidc:
  enabled: true
  issuer: "https://identity.example.com/realms/company"
  clientId: "twentysix-cubed"
  scopes: "openid profile email"
  adminGroup: "twentysix_admin"
  appUrl: "https://acronyms.example.com"
  clientSecret: "<protected-oidc-client-secret>"
  sessionSecret: "<generated-random-secret>"

devUser:
  enabled: false
```

The registry image-pull Secret is set separately by the deploy job.

The Helm chart defaults to the `haproxy` Ingress class. Configure
`ingress.hosts` and `ingress.tls` to use an existing TLS Secret. To have
cert-manager request certificates, set `issuer.enabled`, `issuer.acmeServer`
and `issuer.email`; the chart then creates an ACME Issuer and a Certificate for
each TLS entry. This requires cert-manager to be installed in the cluster.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+ (package manager, scripts and tests)
- Node.js 24+ (runs Next.js)
- PostgreSQL 14+

### Run locally

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

Point `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` at a PostgreSQL database. The quickest way is a
local container:

```bash
docker run -d --name acronyms-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres:17-alpine
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

Then create the schema, load the example data and start the app:

```bash
bun run contract:emit   # generate Prisma types from the data contract
bun run db:migrate      # apply all migrations
bun run db:seed         # 10 users, ~60 acronyms – resets users and glossary data!
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Without OIDC settings you
are signed in as the development user *Felix Weber*.

There are no repositories, service layers or other ceremony: pages call small,
well-named functions that use Prisma directly.

### Data model

Four tables. `ScoreTransaction` is both the score history and the record of
who already submitted which meaning – there is no separate "discovery" table.
When an admin invalidates a meaning, its transactions keep a snapshot of the
acronym and text instead of the deleted rows.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Acronym : "discovered"
    User ||--o{ Meaning : "added"
    User ||--o{ ScoreTransaction : "earned"
    Acronym ||--|{ Meaning : "has"
    Acronym ||--o{ ScoreTransaction : ""
    Meaning ||--o{ ScoreTransaction : ""

    User {
        uuid id "UUIDv7"
        string externalId "id from your identity provider"
        string displayName
        string email
        int score "sum of the user's transactions"
    }
    Acronym {
        uuid id "UUIDv7"
        string code "unique, ^[A-Z]{3}$"
    }
    Meaning {
        uuid id "UUIDv7"
        string text "as displayed"
        string normalizedText "unique per acronym"
    }
    ScoreTransaction {
        uuid id "UUIDv7"
        int amount
        string type "NEW_ACRONYM | EXISTING_ENTRY | DUPLICATE_FOUND | INVALIDATED_MEANING"
        string acronymCode "snapshot after invalidation"
        string meaningText "snapshot after invalidation"
    }
```

### What happens on submit

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Submit acronym + meaning] --> B{Valid?<br/>3 letters, uppercase letters match}
    B -- no --> X[Show validation error]
    B -- yes --> V{Was the meaning<br/>invalidated by an admin?}
    V -- yes --> W[INVALIDATED_MEANING · 0]
    V -- no --> E{Does the acronym exist?}
    E -- no --> F[NEW_ACRONYM · +5<br/>create acronym + meaning]
    E -- yes --> G{Does the normalized<br/>meaning exist?}
    G -- no --> I[DUPLICATE_FOUND · +10<br/>create meaning]
    G -- yes --> C{Has this user already<br/>submitted this meaning?}
    C -- yes --> D[ALREADY_SUBMITTED · 0]
    C -- no --> H[EXISTING_ENTRY · +1]
```

Everything after validation runs in one database transaction: glossary records,
the score transaction and the score update either all happen or none do.

### Data integrity

The rules are enforced by the database, not only by application code:

- unique `Acronym.code` plus a check constraint for `^[A-Z]{3}$`
- unique `(acronymId, normalizedText)` for meanings
- unique `(userId, meaningId)` for score transactions
- scores are incremented in SQL (`score = score + n`), never read-modify-written

If two requests race (a double click, or two people discovering the same
acronym at the same moment), the constraint rejects the second one and the
submission is re-evaluated once against the committed data. A double click
therefore ends as `ALREADY_SUBMITTED`, never as double points.

## Authentication

26³ signs users in with **OpenID Connect** (authorization code flow with PKCE).
Any standards-compliant provider works; nothing in the code is specific to one
vendor.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser
    participant A as 26³
    participant P as Identity provider
    B->>A: open any page
    A-->>B: no session → /auth/login
    B->>P: authorize (PKCE, state, nonce)
    P-->>B: sign in → /auth/callback?code=…
    B->>A: callback
    A->>P: exchange code, validate ID token
    A-->>B: encrypted session cookie → back to the page
```

On every sign-in the user is created or updated from the ID token: `sub`
becomes `User.externalId`, `name` (or `preferred_username`) the display name,
plus `email` and `picture`. The session is an encrypted, HTTP-only cookie that
lasts 7 days; *Sign out* in the header clears it and also ends the session at
the provider if it supports RP-initiated logout.

### Configure your provider

Register 26³ as a client ("web application", authorization code flow) and set:

| Setting                  | Value                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Redirect URI             | `https://<your-app>/auth/callback`      |
| Post-logout redirect URI | `https://<your-app>/`                   |
| Scopes                   | `openid profile email`                  |

Then set `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `APP_URL` and
`SESSION_SECRET` (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)). Typical
issuer URLs:

| Provider            | `OIDC_ISSUER`                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keycloak            | `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/<realm>`               |
| Microsoft Entra ID  | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`        |
| Okta                | `https://<org>.okta.com/oauth2/default`                     |
| Auth0               | `https://<tenant>.auth0.com/`                               |
| Google              | `https://accounts.google.com`                               |
| Authentik           | `https://authentik.example.com/application/o/<slug>/`       |

The issuer must serve `/.well-known/openid-configuration`; everything else is
discovered from there. Plain `http://` issuers are accepted for local testing.

**Keycloak example:** create a client `twentysix-cubed` with *Client
authentication* on and *Standard flow* enabled, add the redirect URIs above,
and copy the secret from the *Credentials* tab:

```bash
OIDC_ISSUER=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/company
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=twentysix-cubed
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<from the Credentials tab>
APP_URL=https://acronyms.example.com
SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

### Admins

Members of the group `twentysix_admin` (change it with `OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP`) see
a button next to every meaning in the search results to **invalidate** it. The
meaning is deleted (with its acronym, if it was the last meaning), everybody who
scored it gets a negative transaction for the same amount, and the meaning can't
be submitted again.

The group is read from the `groups` claim of the ID token at sign-in:

- **Authentik:** the default `profile` scope already includes `groups`. Create
  a group `twentysix_admin` and add the admins.
- **Keycloak:** create a group `twentysix_admin`, then add a *Group Membership*
  mapper (token claim name `groups`, *Add to ID token* on) to the client's
  dedicated scope. Full group paths (`/twentysix_admin`) are accepted for
  top-level groups.

Without a provider, the development user is an admin outside production.

### Without a provider

If `OIDC_ISSUER` is not set, everybody is signed in as one shared development
user – handy for local development. In production (`NODE_ENV=production`) this
is refused unless you set `AUTH_DEV_USER=true` explicitly, so a missing
configuration can't silently open the app to everyone.

All code asks a single function for the current user –
`getCurrentUser()` in [`lib/auth.ts`](lib/auth.ts) – so a different login
mechanism would only need to change that file.

## Internationalization

All texts live in [`lib/i18n.ts`](lib/i18n.ts). The English dictionary defines
the shape; every other language must provide the same keys, so a missing
translation is a type error. To add a language:

1. Add the locale code to `LOCALES`, a name to `localeNames` and a formatting
   locale to `intlLocales`.
2. Add a dictionary of type `Dictionary` and register it in `dictionaries`.

The language is taken from a cookie set by the switcher in the header, falling
back to the browser's `Accept-Language`.

## Development

| Command                           | Description                                      |

| `bun run db:migrate`              | Apply pending migrations                         |

### Tests

Validation tests always run. The scoring tests use a real PostgreSQL database
and **wipe it before each test**, so they only run when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is
set:

```bash
docker run -d --rm --name acronyms-test-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 54329:5432 postgres:17-alpine
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54329/postgres
bun run db:migrate --db $TEST_DATABASE_URL
bun run test
```

They cover all scoring outcomes, invalidation, normalization, the database
constraints and concurrent double submissions.

### Changing the data model

Edit [`src/prisma/contract.prisma`](src/prisma/contract.prisma), then:

```bash
bun run contract:emit
bun run migration:plan --name describe_the_change
bun run db:migrate
```

## Deployment

The app builds to a standalone Node.js server (`output: "standalone"`):

```bash
bun run build
cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/static   # standalone output does not include static assets
bun run db:migrate   # against the production DATABASE_URL
bun run start
```

Any platform that runs Node.js 24 and can reach PostgreSQL works – a VM, a
container platform or Kubernetes.

### Docker

The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) builds two images from the same source:

| Image                     | Build                                  | Contents                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `twentysix-cubed`         | `docker build .`                       | `node:24-slim` with only the standalone server, non-root (~430 MB) |
| `twentysix-cubed-migrate` | `docker build --target migrate .`      | Prisma CLI + migrations, runs `db migrate` once and exits        |

```bash
docker build -t twentysix-cubed .
docker build -t twentysix-cubed-migrate --target migrate .
```

Apply migrations, then start the app with your database and OIDC settings:

```bash
docker run --rm -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://… twentysix-cubed-migrate

docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://… \
  -e OIDC_ISSUER=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/company \
  -e OIDC_CLIENT_ID=twentysix-cubed \
  -e OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=… \
  -e APP_URL=https://acronyms.example.com \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=… \
  twentysix-cubed
```

For a quick demo without a provider, replace the `OIDC_*`, `APP_URL` and
`SESSION_SECRET` variables with `-e AUTH_DEV_USER=true`.

Pass values without quotes; `docker run --env-file` keeps them and the
connection string becomes invalid.

### Kubernetes (Helm)

The chart in [`helm/`](helm) deploys the app and runs the migration image as a
`pre-install`/`pre-upgrade` hook. Supply the database URL and OIDC credentials
through a protected values file; Helm stores them in one `<release>-secret`.
The migration hook receives the database URL directly because it runs before
that Secret is created. To reuse a Secret provisioned outside Helm, leave all
database and OIDC secret values empty and create one `<release>-secret` with the
configured keys.

```bash
helm install twentysix-cubed ./helm \
  --values /secure/path/production-values.yaml \
  --set image.repository=ghcr.io/<you>/twentysix-cubed \
  --set migrations.image.repository=ghcr.io/<you>/twentysix-cubed-migrate \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.hosts[0].host=acronyms.example.com \
  --set oidc.enabled=true \
  --set oidc.issuer=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/company \
  --set oidc.clientId=twentysix-cubed \
  --set oidc.appUrl=https://acronyms.example.com
```

See [`helm/values.yaml`](helm/values.yaml) for all options.

### Releases (GitHub Actions)

Two workflows in [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows) build and publish
everything to the GitHub Container Registry:

| Workflow                                         | Pull request              | Push to `main`                          | Tag `v1.2.3`                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [`docker.yml`](.github/workflows/docker.yml)     | builds both images        | pushes `:main` and `:sha-…`             | pushes `:1.2.3` and `:1.2`                    |
| [`helm.yml`](.github/workflows/helm.yml)         | lints, packages chart as workflow artifact | pushes chart `<version>-dev.<sha>` (appVersion `sha-…`) | pushes chart `1.2.3` (appVersion `1.2.3`) and attaches it to the GitHub release |

Images are built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. To release, tag a
commit and push the tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

The chart's default image tag is its own version, so a released chart always
runs the images of the same release:

| Artifact        | Location                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| App image       | `ghcr.io/felixgaebler/twentysix-cubed`              |
| Migration image | `ghcr.io/felixgaebler/twentysix-cubed-migrate`      |
| Helm chart      | `oci://ghcr.io/felixgaebler/charts/twentysix-cubed` |

```bash
helm install twentysix-cubed oci://ghcr.io/felixgaebler/charts/twentysix-cubed --version 0.1.0 \
  --set ingress.enabled=true --set ingress.hosts[0].host=acronyms.example.com
```

### Prisma Compute

The repository also contains a ready-made setup for
[Prisma Compute](https://www.prisma.io): the GitHub Actions workflow in
`.github/workflows` uses Prisma Composer (`module.ts`) to provision Prisma
Postgres, apply migrations and deploy on every push. Connect it once with:

```bash
bun run compute:login
bun run compute:connect
```

## Design decisions and technical debt

Decisions that trade something off, written down so they can be revisited
deliberately instead of rediscovered.

| Decision | Why | Cost / debt | Revisit when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Create one shared app Secret from Helm values; pass its database URL directly to the migration hook** | One release configures the app and its runtime credentials; first-install migrations do not wait for a Secret that Helm has not created yet | Credentials are stored in Helm release metadata, one Kubernetes Secret and the migration Job specification; access must be restricted | An external secret manager is available and should own secret lifecycle |
| **CPU and memory requests and limits for app and migration containers** | Supports namespaces whose resource quotas require all four allocations | Default limits can throttle CPU or terminate memory-heavy workloads; tune the values for the deployment | Observed resource usage exceeds the defaults |
| **Multi-arch images** (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`), arm64 emulated with QEMU on standard GitHub runners | Runs on ARM servers (AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, Hetzner CAX) and Apple Silicon without rebuilding | Image builds take several times longer than amd64 alone | Build times hurt: switch to native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners and merge the manifests |
| **Separate migration image** with the full Prisma CLI | The runtime image stays slim (~430 MB, standalone server only) | The migration image is ~2.9 GB, because the Prisma CLI needs all dependencies | Prisma ships a standalone migration binary |
| **Separate [migration Dockerfile](Dockerfile.migrate) for GitLab Kaniko** | Uses the shared template's Dockerfile input without relying on an undocumented target flag | Must stay aligned with the migration target in the main Dockerfile | The shared template exposes a supported build-target input |
| **Prisma 8 release candidate** | Contract-first data layer, typed queries, no code generation | Pre-release APIs may change before 8.0 | Prisma 8.0 is stable |
| **Temporal polyfill** (`temporal-polyfill`) | Prisma 8 date fields use the `Temporal` API, which Node.js 24 doesn't ship | One extra runtime dependency | Node.js ships `Temporal` |
| **UUIDv7 primary keys** (native `uuid` columns, generated by Prisma) | Ids can't be guessed or enumerated, don't reveal how many rows exist, and stay roughly time-ordered for indexes | 16 instead of 4 bytes per key; ids are less readable in logs and URLs | Never, unless storage or index size becomes a problem |
| **Cached score on `User`** | The scoreboard is a single cheap query | Denormalized; kept consistent by incrementing in SQL inside the same transaction as the score transaction | Scoring rules become retroactive |
| **Stateless sessions** (encrypted cookie, 7 days, no refresh against the provider) | No session store, no extra infrastructure | A user disabled at the identity provider keeps access until the cookie expires | Offboarding must take effect immediately: shorter lifetime or refresh tokens |
| **`email` is unique and required** | Simple user model | Users without an `email` claim get a placeholder address; an email already used by another account makes sign-in fail | Several identity providers per instance |
| **New meanings earn the most points (+10)** | Finding ambiguity is the core of the game | Easy to farm with made-up meanings whose uppercase letters spell the acronym | Admins can invalidate them; revisit if that isn't enough |
| **Admin role from the ID token's `groups` claim**, stored in the session cookie | No role table, roles are managed where users are | Adding or removing an admin takes effect at the next sign-in (up to 7 days) | Role changes must apply immediately |
| **Invalidation deletes the meaning, but keeps its transactions** with a snapshot and adds negative ones | History stays complete and explains the lost points; the negative transactions also block resubmission without an extra table | `ScoreTransaction.acronymId`/`meaningId` are nullable; blocking checks normalize the snapshot texts of an acronym in code | Invalidations become frequent or need a reason / undo |
| **Only uppercase letters count** for the acronym check | Supports real-world acronyms that skip words (*Allocation and Offer Force* → `AOF`) | Users must capitalize every word that belongs to the acronym (*Point Of Sale*); all-lowercase input is rejected | Users find it confusing: accept first letters *or* uppercase letters |
| **Scoring tests need a real PostgreSQL** | Constraints, transactions and races can't be mocked meaningfully | They are skipped unless `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set and don't run in CI yet | A Postgres service container is added to CI |

## Ideas

- Moderation: edit or merge meanings, report nonsense
- Import an existing glossary from CSV
- Achievements, e.g. "first to find a triple meaning"
- A weekly digest of new discoveries

## Built with AI

This project was written entirely by prompting an AI coding agent (GitHub
Copilot in VS Code). Every line of code, the tests, the illustrations and this
README were generated from natural-language instructions; Felix Gaebler
decided what to build, reviewed the results and asked for changes.

That does not make it special code: it is reviewed, linted, type-checked and
tested like any other project. Treat it the same way – read it before you run
it in your company, and open an issue if something looks wrong.
